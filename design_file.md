Master Mind:

Code breaking game. One player is a code maker and the other a code breaker.
A code of 4 colored pegs is chosen from a possible 6.
The code breaker than has a set amount of chances to and guess the code.
Feed back is given if a guessed peg is both the right spot and the right
color or just the right color.
Games ends when the code is guessed or when the allowed amount of guesses is reached.
